After enumeration with ls -la we find a folder called ./backup. In this folder there is a HTML file called bookmarks.html
After grepping the file with leviathan we find the password

Password: 3QJ3TgzHDq

## levi 2:
Using ``ltrace`` we can find the program uses `strcmp` to check the password
We find the ``strcmp`` function indeed using ``strings``

We find here that the password is `sex`
After the check is complete we gain privilege to become ``leviathan2`` thus we can get the password from `/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2` as indicated in the instructions

Password: NsN1HwFoyN

## levi 3:
Using `ltrace` with a valid file we can pinpoint the exploit: in `snprintf` if we input two files seperated by a space only the first one is read.
So to open the password file, we create a file containing a space, then associate the first word of that name with a symbolic link to the password file so when we open the file with the space the access function checks the whole name and bypass the restriction on the password file

After some testing we figured that the password is ``snlprintf`` as we can see in the last `strcmp`

We convert the binary using any available tool

We need to disassemble the binary to find if the pin is visible in the assembly code
We will use gdb for the dynamic analysis
![[Pasted image 20251120012921.png]]

We add a breakpoint in the `atoi` call to see how the input gets compared
![[Pasted image 20251120013352.png]]

In line +34 we see that we compare the input with `ebp-0xc` with out initial input from `eax` 

We can calculate the address to it then dump its content

We found the pin
