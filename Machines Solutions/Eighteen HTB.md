## What is a dMSA ?
A dMSA is typically created to replace any existing legacy service account. To enable a seamless transition, a dMSA can inherit the permissions of the legacy account by performing a migration process. This migration flow tightly couples the dMSA to the *superseded account*, that is the original account they meant to replace. That flow and the permissions it grants along the way is where things get interesting.

The migration process of a dMSA can be trigered by calling the new **Start-ADServiceAccountMigration** cmdlet.
Internally, it calls a new LDAP rootDSE operation named **migrateADServiceAccount**, which takes the following arguments: 
	- The Distinguished Name (DN) of the dMSA
	- The DN of the superseded account
	- A constant corresponding to *StartMigration*

The migration status of a dMSA is dictated by the **msDS-DelegatedMSAStateAttribute**, anew attribute that determines the current state of the dMSA. There is currently no official documentation of this attribute, so the following table is based on a personal behavioral analysis and experimentation:
